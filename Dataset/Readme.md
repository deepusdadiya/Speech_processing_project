**Description of Dataset:**

•	**Genres original -** A collection of 10 genres with 100 audio files each, all having a length of 30 seconds (the famous GTZAN dataset, the MNIST of sounds)

•	**2 CSV files -** Containing features of the audio files. One file has for each song (30 seconds long) a mean and variance computed over multiple features that can be extracted from an audio file. 
The other file has the same structure, but the songs were split before into 3 seconds audio files (this way increasing 10 times the amount of data we fuel into our classification models). With data, more is always better.
