**Summary of the project:**

This project discusses the importance and practical applications of music genre classification using machine learning techniques. Two different approaches are presented, one using .wav files and MFCC feature extraction for KNN classification, and the other using pre-extracted features from CSV files. The implementation of both approaches is described in detail, along with model building and evaluation. The project highlights the significance of music classification in creating personalized listening experiences and understanding the cultural and historical context of different genres. We observed that KNN is a simple and efficient classification algorithm that can handle high-dimensional data, and we implemented it from scratch in our approach 1. We achieved an accuracy of approximately 70%, which can be considered a good start. In approach 2, we explored multiple classification algorithms and achieved an accuracy of 88.41% using XGB Classifier. We found that the KNN algorithm was also effective in this context, achieving an accuracy of 86.74%. The decision tree classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes were less effective, achieving accuracies of 62.45%, 51.80%, and 46.98%, respectively.
